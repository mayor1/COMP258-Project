COMP258-Project
===============

The following java project is our crossword search generator code. The following classes work together to create a randomized
wordsearch with words input by the user. The user is what will decide what is put into the program. We may plan to have it work
with the basics needed first and then will see how much time is left to add extra features that are not vital to a working 
project.
